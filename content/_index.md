In this self-paced workshop, you will reinforce your learning of cloud fundamentals such as EC2, S3, EBS, etc. while 
diving deep on automation topics. The assignments are selected from various sources, including acloudguru, AWS
documentation, public information on YouTube, etc.

An important topic in modern IT operations is the concept of Infastructure as Code -- as this is realistic only in 
cloud computing environments like AWS. Infrastructure as Code allows developers, support engineers, and architects to
define the infrastruture for an application as code (and store it in version control, just like the application code itself).

This section covers:

1. Infrastructure as Code tools like Cloudformation and Terraform

2. Deployment techniques such as Blue/Green and Canary

3. The Serverless Application Model

4. So-called Microframeworks like AWS Chalice to develop and deploy APIs
